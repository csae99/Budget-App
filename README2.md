Sure, let's break down the configuration step by step:

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for your Ruby on Rails application. Here's what each part does:

```Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.1.2
```
- This specifies the base image for the Docker build. In this case, it’s the official Ruby 3.1.2 image.

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```
- This sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs yarn
```
- This updates the package lists and installs Node.js and Yarn. Node.js is required to compile JavaScript assets, and Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript.

```Dockerfile
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
```
- This copies the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` into the working directory inside the container.

```Dockerfile
RUN gem install bundler:2.3.6
RUN bundle install
```
- This installs a specific version of Bundler and then runs `bundle install` to install Ruby dependencies specified in the Gemfile.

```Dockerfile
COPY . .
```
- This copies the rest of the application code into the working directory inside the container.

```Dockerfile
RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```
- This precompiles the assets, which is a necessary step for production environments to optimize the delivery of static assets.

```Dockerfile
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/entrypoint.sh
```
- This copies the entrypoint script into the `/usr/bin` directory inside the container and makes it executable.

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```
- This informs Docker that the container listens on port 3000.

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["bash", "-c", "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec rails server -b 0.0.0.0"]
```
- `ENTRYPOINT` specifies the script to run to start the container. `CMD` provides default arguments for the entrypoint script. In this case, it removes any pre-existing server PID file and starts the Rails server.

### entrypoint.sh

This script ensures that necessary setup tasks are performed before the main process (Rails server) starts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Remove a potentially pre-existing server.pid for Rails.
rm -f /app/tmp/pids/server.pid

# Run database migrations
bundle exec rake db:migrate

# Then exec the container's main process (what's set as CMD in the Dockerfile).
exec "$@"
```
- `#!/bin/bash` specifies the script should be run in the bash shell.
- `set -e` makes the script exit immediately if any command fails.
- `rm -f /app/tmp/pids/server.pid` removes any existing server PID file to prevent conflicts.
- `bundle exec rake db:migrate` runs database migrations to ensure the database schema is up to date.
- `exec "$@"` runs the main process (Rails server in this case) as specified in the Dockerfile’s `CMD`.

### docker-compose.yml

This file defines the multi-container setup for your application using Docker Compose.

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    depends_on:
      - db
    env_file:
      - .env  # Ensure this file exists with necessary environment variables
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=Budgy
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Budgy
      - POSTGRES_DB=budgy_development
    command: ["bash", "-c", "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec rails server -b 0.0.0.0"]
  db:
    image: postgres:14.1
    volumes:
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=Budgy
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Budgy
      - POSTGRES_DB=budgy_development

volumes:
  pgdata:
```
- `version: '3.9'` specifies the version of Docker Compose syntax.
- `services:` defines the services that make up your application.

**Service: `web`**
- `build: .` builds the Docker image for the web service using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
- `ports: - "3000:3000"` maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container.
- `volumes: - .:/app` mounts the current directory on the host to `/app` in the container, allowing for live code changes.
- `depends_on: - db` specifies that the `web` service depends on the `db` service, ensuring it starts after the database.
- `env_file: - .env` loads environment variables from the `.env` file.
- `environment:` defines additional environment variables directly.
- `command:` specifies the command to run in the container, in this case starting the Rails server after ensuring no stale server PID file exists.

**Service: `db`**
- `image: postgres:14.1` specifies the Docker image for the database service.
- `volumes: - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data` mounts a directory on the host to persist PostgreSQL data.
- `environment:` sets environment variables for the PostgreSQL container.

**volumes:**
- `pgdata:` defines a named volume for persisting PostgreSQL data.

### .env

This file contains environment variables used by the Docker Compose configuration.

```env
# PostgreSQL settings
POSTGRES_USER=Budgy
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Budgy
POSTGRES_DB=budgy_development

# Rails environment settings
RAILS_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgres://Budgy:Budgy@db:5432/budgy_development
```
- `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` are used to configure the PostgreSQL database.
- `RAILS_ENV=development` sets the Rails environment to development.
- `DATABASE_URL` provides the database connection string for the Rails application.

This configuration ensures that when you run `docker-compose up`, it will:
1. Build the Docker image for your Rails application.
2. Start a PostgreSQL database container.
3. Run the database migrations.
4. Start the Rails server, making the application accessible on port 3000.
